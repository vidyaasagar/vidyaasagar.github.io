### Angular Concepts
Every framework has some core concepts as a foundation for building robust web applications.Angular also does have some concepts such as follows:

#### What is a Cross Origin Attribute ?
* It is a security feature used in web development that allows or restricts scripts, stylesheets, images 
  and other different domains to interact with each other.

#### What is Babel ?
* Babel is a JavaScript transpiler that converts modern JavaScript code into a backward-compatible 
 version that can run in older browsers. It is commonly used in web development to ensure compatibility
 across different platforms.

#### What is webpack ?
* Webpack is a module bundler for JavaScript applications. It takes modules with dependencies and 
 generates a single bundle that can be loaded by a browser.

#### Can you name some other bundler ?
* Some other popular module bundlers are Browserify, Rollup, Parcel and FuseBox.

#### Can you explain the differnce between the SSR and CSR  in react ?
* SSR and CSR two ways of rendering the react components. SSR involves on the server side and sending the fully rendered HTML to the client, while CSR involves the rendering react components on the client side browser using the javascript. SSR is achieved by using Node.JS to execute the JS code and generate the HTML markup, which is sent to the client as a complete HTML page. This approach improves SEO and initial page load time, but can be slower for subsequent updates. CSR involves sending a minimal HTML page and a JS bundle containing the react component and application logic to the client. Tbe browser then downloads the bundle, executes it, and renders the component in the browser. This approach allows for greater interactivity and faster updates, but can be slower for initial page load.
